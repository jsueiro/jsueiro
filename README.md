### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juan
And I've been coding stuff for the past 20 years 
...well, "professionally" for about two to three years first, 
and then life took me to the dark side ![kindpng_311899](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1832377/161396863-4161b703-3291-4de6-9e91-c477c089f051.png) and I became a SysAdmin -> fast forward to today into management.

Still, software engineering's been always a passion, so now I restarted a parallel path to refresh my knowledge as a full stack dev. 

Here you'll find some little experiments and contributions I'm currently working on. 

Cheers !
